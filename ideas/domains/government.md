# Government & Public Sector

Governments need transparent, explainable, and auditable AI (XAI) for policy, service delivery, and emergency response. Snapshot-driven simulation and policy-testing enable evidence-based governance.

## Key Uses

* Policy simulation (e.g., economic models) using historical snapshots to validate outcomes.
* Transparent decision systems for permits, benefits, or licensing that are auditable end-to-end.

## Implications

* Data sovereignty, access control, and provenance are paramount for public trust.
* Governance policies can be encoded as pre-deployment checks with `@proof` attestations. Every artefact is catalogued in the semantic `fusion` knowledge base. 

## Opportunities

* Public transparent repositories of certified, golden models for civic use-cases.
* Emergency response digital twins that replay real-time sensor tensors to plan interventions.

## Novel Use Cases

* Pre-deployment policy simulators that predict compliance outcomes of AI-driven policy changes.
