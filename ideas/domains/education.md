# Education & Training

Snapshots and explainable artifacts transform how we teach ML and AI: students can read and compose algorithms with less cognitive load, the developer lifecycle is streamlined and optimized. Supporting experimentation, we can step through tensor ticks and explore decision paths interactively.

## Key Uses

* Interactive labs where students replay and modify snapshots to observe how model behavior changes.
* Teaching explainability using provenance bundles and golden assets for experiment reproducibility.

## Implications

* Sanitized, privacy-preserving snapshots are needed for public education materials.
* Curriculum can include reproducible artifact construction and governance principles.

## Opportunities

* Certification programs using golden assets as canonical tests for competency and reproducibility.
* Educational sandboxes that allow safe experimentation via branching snapshots.

## Novel Use Cases

* Graduated training datasets with semantic tags so learners see how model behavior evolves as data changes.
