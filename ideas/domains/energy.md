# Energy & Utilities

Energy systems (grid, generation, distribution) require resilient, auditable control and forecasting models. Snapshot-driven simulation and golden artifacts support regulatory reporting and safety-critical validation.

## Key Uses

* Load forecasting and demand-response control models with reproducible training and signed golden artifacts.
* Anomaly detection in sensor networks with content-addressed incident snapshots for rapid remediation.

## Implications

* High-availability storage for snapshots and strict access controls for operational data are required.
* Proofs and governance checks are important for certified control loops.

## Opportunities

* Simulation-based planning: branch from historical grid snapshots to validate emergency responses.
* Traceable firmware/model rollouts with frozen artifacts and device-targeted variants.

## Novel Use Cases

* Grid incident forensics that replay sensor and model tensors to reconstruct cascading failures.
