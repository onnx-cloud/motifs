# Transportation & Logistics

Transportation systems benefit from real-time, composable models for routing, demand prediction, and fleet optimization. The tensor bus enables low-latency data sharing and snapshot-driven incident reconstruction.

## Key Uses

* Real-time routing models composed from perception, prediction, and planning subgraphs.
* Fleet-level anomaly detection with snapshot-based forensics for incidents.

## Implications

* Edge-first snapshot strategies and bandwidth-conscious snapshot compression are needed.
* Safety proofs and golden assets are necessary for compliant deployment in public systems.

## Opportunities

* Digital twins that replay traffic tensor streams to evaluate policy or infrastructure changes.
* Federated namespaces where operators share sanitized snapshots for collaborative optimization.

## Novel Use Cases

* Post-accident replay systems that reconstruct the tensor bus state across vehicles and infrastructure.
