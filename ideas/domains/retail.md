# Retail & E-commerce

AI in retail focuses on personalization, supply-chain optimization, demand forecasting, and fraud detection. The snapshot + global ONNX namespace approach provides traceable personalization and auditable trade decisions.

## Key Uses

* Personalized recommendations with traceable input tensors and golden validation sets.
* Inventory optimization and demand forecasting with reproducible training artifacts.

## Implications

* Privacy-preserving snapshotting and selective redaction are critical for customer data.
* Provenance is important for reconciling recommendations and promotions with business rules.

## Opportunities

* Experimentation platforms that branch from real sales snapshots to evaluate promotions.
* Certified recommendation subgraphs that comply with fairness and transparency proofs.

## Novel Use Cases

* Transparent dispute resolution where a customer's recommendation trace and inputs are replayable for evidence.
