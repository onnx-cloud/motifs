# Healthcare & Life Sciences

AI in healthcare demands high assurance: auditable models, reproducible training, and robust privacy protections. The tensor-snapshot + global-onnx namespace model directly supports clinical traceability and regulatory submissions.

## Key Uses

* Diagnostic and imaging models with full tensor-level replay and explainability artifacts.
* Clinical decision support where every inference is auditable and traceable to input snapshots.

## Implications

* Strong privacy controls and governance are required to ensure PII is never exposed in shared snapshots.
* Proofs and golden artifacts simplify regulatory review by providing reproducible bundles.

## Opportunities

* Snapshot-driven retrospective analysis for adverse event investigation and root-cause reconstruction.
* Certified model catalogs for health systems with proof-based access control.

## Novel Use Cases

* Clinical trial assistants that replay historical patient tensors to validate new models under identical conditions.
* Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration that attaches provenance and proofs to deployed prediction models.
