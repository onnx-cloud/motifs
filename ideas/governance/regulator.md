# Role: Regulator

Regulators need transparent, reproducible evidence to evaluate AI systems. Snapshot-based artifacts and signed proofs simplify compliance review and independent verification.

## Responsibilities

* Define compliance criteria and acceptable proofs for models in regulated domains.
* Provide mechanisms for auditors to replay and validate decisions from golden artifacts.

## Implications

* Standardization of minimal reproducible bundles for review and audit is beneficial.
* Tools for privacy-preserving replay and redaction are necessary to protect sensitive data during audits.

## Opportunities

* Regulatory sandboxes that accept signed golden artifacts and proofs for rapid evaluation.
* Policy-driven certification services that issue attestations usable by operators and marketplaces.
