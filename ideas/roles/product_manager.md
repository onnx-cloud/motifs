# Role: Product Manager

Product managers translate user needs into measurable objectives and acceptance criteria. Provenance, golden assets, and snapshot-driven tests provide the evidence needed to make product decisions and prioritize risk.

## Responsibilities

* Define success metrics and acceptance tests that map to golden assets and snapshot suites.
* Coordinate cross-functional decisions around governance, risk, and deployment cadence.

## Implications

* Product requirements should include reproducible acceptance criteria and tolerances for snapshot diffs.
* Close collaboration with ML Engineers and Data Scientists around artifact lifecycles and proofs.

## Opportunities

* Product-led templates for acceptance suites that automatically validate candidate artifacts against golden snapshots.
* Experiment catalogs that tie outcomes back to snapshot inputs for transparent decision-making.
