# Role: Data Scientist

Data scientists design experiments, prepare datasets, and validate model behavior. In this ecosystem, reproducibility and snapshot-driven analysis are core to their workflows.

## Responsibilities

* Define training objectives and dataset selection; attach semantic metadata to samples.
* Create reproducible experiments by referencing `freezer` snapshots and `@training` manifests.

## Implications

* Need for tools that make it easy to query and sample from the global namespace.
* Collaboration with governance and engineering teams to ensure fair, tested datasets.

## Opportunities

* Snapshot-driven exploratory analysis and branching for rapid hypothesis testing.
* Example-driven reproducibility where experiments re-run from minimal provenance bundles.
