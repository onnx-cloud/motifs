# 09 — Visualization: Making Data Legible

Abstract concepts are hard to evaluate. Visualization translates ontologies, coverage statistics, and gaps into concrete images.

The visualizations here are generated: SPARQL queries extract data from the RDF ontology, Vega-Lite specifications define rendering, and Python scripts orchestrate the pipeline. This reproducibility is essential. If a figure is surprising, the query and data are traceable.

Visuals in this project serve a specific purpose: identifying gaps in coverage, revealing clustering in the motif taxonomy, and measuring progress toward completeness.
