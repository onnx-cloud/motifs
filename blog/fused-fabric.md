# Fused Fabric 🧵

**Overview:**
A formal unification of static semantic grounding (Typed Reality) and dynamic computational reasoning (Compiled Cognition), producing a mathematical framework (Fused Fabric) where ontologies and compute graphs interplay.

## Sections & Key Points

- **Introduction** — Motivation for fusing ontological grounding with computational graphs.
- **Dual Fabrics** — Conceptual separation and integration of ontological (semantic) vs computational fabrics.
- **Ontological Grounding** — Use of RDF, SOSA/SSN, QUDT, and SKOS to ground semantics in measurable reality.
- **Graph Fusion** — Algorithms and fusion strategies that preserve semantics while optimizing graphs.
- **Unification Formalism** — Mathematical formalism for proving correctness of fusion and type preservation.
- **RDF Model** — RDF-encoded models facilitating queries, verification, and tooling integration.
- **Implementation & Silicon** — Practical considerations for implementing the fused fabric and mapping to hardware.
- **Related Work & Conclusion** — Positioning and roadmap.
