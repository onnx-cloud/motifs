# 12 — Continuation: Future Work

This framework is a beginning, not a conclusion. Open questions remain:

- **Mechanization**: Coq proofs are skeletal. Completing the proofs and verifying them mechanically would strengthen confidence.
- **Scaling**: The ontology has grown to cover 100+ motifs. Maintaining consistency and completeness at larger scale requires tooling improvements.
- **Domain semantics**: Current work handles generic types. Collaboration with domain experts (robotics, signal processing, physics) would enrich semantic specifications.
- **Integration**: Building practical systems that use Fused Fabric end-to-end requires compiler maturation and ecosystem development.

Contribution is encouraged. The repository is open. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
