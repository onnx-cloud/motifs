# 11 — Lessons: What We Learned

Progress required reversals:

- **Tests as specification**: Motif implementations converged faster when tests were written first, clarifying intent and catching regressions early.
- **Documentation as design**: Writing formal specifications for the ontology and SPARQL queries exposed ambiguities and inconsistencies. Documentation was not an afterthought but a core design activity.
- **Practical constraints matter**: Theoretical elegance is secondary to systems that work. Edge cases in real models drove refinements.
