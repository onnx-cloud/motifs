# 10 — Implementation: Ideas Made Concrete

Ideas must be implemented. The codebase includes:

- RDF ontologies defining the motif taxonomy and ONNX mappings
- Compilation pipeline: Fuse DSL, type checker, lowering to ONNX
- Visualization generators driven by SPARQL queries
- Experiments: learning with projection, adaptive sensor optimization
- Tests: verifying motif implementations and semantic constraints

The goal is reproducibility. Results should be replicable with minimal setup. Notebooks document experiments. Code is version-controlled. Data pipelines are auditable.
