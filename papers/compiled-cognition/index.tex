\begin{abstract}
As machine intelligence moves from monolithic models to complex reasoning pipelines, the gap between high-level cognitive intent and low-level machine execution (silicon) becomes a critical bottleneck. We introduce the \emph{Cognitive Compiler}, a system that transforms high-level reasoning specifications into optimized, machine-native intermediate representations (IR), specifically targeting the ONNX standard. By treating reasoning as a first-class compilation target, we enable the formal fusion of heterogeneous compute graphs directly into verifiable, executable structures. This paper details the architecture of the Fuse-based cognitive IR, the graph-fusion strategies that preserve semantic invariants, and demonstrates the system's utility through the compilation of complex scoring and decision-making logic into performant silicon-ready code.
