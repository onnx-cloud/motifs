\section{Formal Grammar of the Fuse-IR}

The syntax for the cognitive compiler is defined by a strict grammar that enforces the separation of metadata and logic.

\begin{verbatim}
File ::= { Pragma } { Decl }

Pragma ::= "@" Ident [ Value ]
Decl   ::= ConstDecl | GraphDef | ProofGraph

ConstDecl ::= "const" Ident ":" Type "=" Value

GraphDef ::= "graph" Name "(" [ Params ] ")" "->" Type "{" 
               { Statement } 
             "}"

Statement ::= Binding | OpCall
Binding   ::= Ident ":" Type "=" Value
OpCall    ::= Ident "=" Operator "(" [ Args ] ")"

Operator ::= "Sub" | "Abs" | "ReduceSum" | "Div" | "Reshape" | ...

ProofGraph ::= "@proof graph" Name "(" ")" "{" 
                 { Statement } 
                 "assert" Expression 
               "}"
\end{verbatim}
