\begin{abstract}
We present \emph{Cognitive Closure}, the terminal unification of the machine intelligence stack. Building upon the static grounding of \emph{Typed Reality} and the computational fusion of \emph{Compiled Cognition}, we extend the cognitive compiler to support a formally bound backward pass. By introducing high-level training pragmas---namely \texttt{@training}, \texttt{@frozen}, and \texttt{@train}---we enable the differentiable optimization of the \emph{Fused Fabric} under strict ontological constraints. This system allows for the emergence of a "Formally Bound Latent Space": a shared, interpretable domain where human engineers, autonomous AI agents, and emerging AGI can collaborate, comprehend, and co-train with mathematical guarantees of semantic preservation. We demonstrate that by closing the loop between observation, reasoning, and learning, we achieve a stable state of machine comprehension where the "black-box" nature of neural updates is replaced by verifiable state transitions in a grounded reality fabric.
