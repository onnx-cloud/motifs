\section{Introduction}

The arc of this research has moved from the static to the dynamic: from the grounding of raw sensors (\emph{Typed Reality}) to the fusion of computational intent (\emph{Compiled Cognition}), and finally to their topological unification (\emph{Fused Fabric}). However, a system that can only execute what is currently known is incomplete. True intelligence requires the ability to update its internal representation of the world while maintaining the formal integrity of that world.

We introduce \emph{Cognitive Closure}. In this phase, the Cognitive Compiler is no longer restricted to the forward-pass execution of fixed graphs. It now encompasses the \emph{backward-pass}: the differentiable optimization of parameters under the oversight of ontological constraints. 

By closing this loop, we move from "Machine Learning" (unconstrained optimization) to "Targeted Comprehension" (constrained refinement). The result is a system where learning is not a stochastic drift in a vacuum, but a verifiable navigation of the grounded fabric of reality.
