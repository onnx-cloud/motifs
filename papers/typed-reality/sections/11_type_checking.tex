\section{Type Checking and Guarantees}

\subsection{Compile-Time Checks}
The type checker validates:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Shape Unification}: symbols refined, ranges narrowed; no shape conflict reaches runtime.
  \item \textbf{DType Compatibility}: no implicit numeric casts; morphs declare exact DType.
  \item \textbf{Semantic Coherence}: Measurement units match; Distribution-aware ops are applied only to Distribution types; Enum vocabularies align.
\end{enumerate}
Rejects ill-typed programs statically. Where checks cannot be discharged (e.g., dynamic sequence length), emits explicit runtime Assert.

\subsection{Formal Properties}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Progress}: \emph{Well-typed graphs execute without shape or DType errors.} (Proof: by induction over type check, every morph's output matches successor's input.)
  \item \textbf{Semantic Preservation}: \emph{Tensor semantics flow through morphs.} Measurement frame is preserved; Distribution normalization is enforced; Enum bounds are maintained. No implicit unit conversion or categorical collapse.
  \item \textbf{Scope}: Types ensure internal compositional correctness, not physical ground truth. A sensor may malfunction, but the type system ensures the erroneous data is processed consistently and fails explicitly if constraints are violated.
\end{itemize}
