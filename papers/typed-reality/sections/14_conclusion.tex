\section{Conclusion}

We present a statically typed ABI and AST that grounds machine intelligence in reality by fusing heterogeneous knowledge realms. Sensors produce Measurement types (physical reality). Symbolic knowledge enters as Enum types. Probabilistic models output Distribution types. Type-preserving morphs enable safe composition and explicit projection between realms. The ABI lowers to any runtime---ONNX, custom kernels, specialized hardware---ensuring semantic invariants are preserved end-to-end.

Test and train graphs are identical in structure and semantics, enabling reproducible validation. Compile-time type checking rejects semantic unsafe programs; runtime assertions are explicit and elided when provably safe. By embedding DType, Shape, and Semantics into tensors, we achieve deterministic mapping of observations to computation to action, enabling machines to interpret the world with formal, verifiable reasoning grounded in measurable reality.

Future work includes richer semantic ontologies (physical unit systems, stochastic process types), certified compiler backends with formal proofs of semantic preservation, and integration with symbolic reasoning systems to bridge discrete and continuous knowledge.
