# Typed Reality — Terse summary

Core idea: A typed formalism for sensor modalities and computational primitives that enforces correctness in graph construction and lowering.

Formalisms: Strong type system, EBNF for grammar, typed primitives and semantics, and a formal type-checking and lowering pipeline to target execution representations.

Conclusion: Enables safer model construction and automated lowering with provable typing properties; supports LLM-generatability and formal verification of transformations.
