\section{Related Work}

Our work sits at the intersection of three fields: neural-symbolic systems, formal type theory, and semantic sensor networks.

\paragraph{Neural-Symbolic Integration}
The "Neuro-Symbolic" movement has long sought to blend the two fabrics \citep{garcez2020}. However, existing approaches often treat the symbolic layer as a "wrapper" rather than a constitutive part of the tensor structure. Our approach differs by embedding the grounding directly into the DType/Shape/Semantics triple.

\paragraph{Dependently Typed ML}
Languages like Dex \citep{dex2022} and Futhark \citep{futhark2016} have introduced richer type systems for numeric computation. We extend this work to include \emph{semantic} types grounded in external ontologies.

\paragraph{Semantic Web and AI}
The use of RDF to describe deep learning models has been explored in projects like OntoCNN, but these systems typically focus on documentation rather than serving as the source-of-truth for silicon lowering and graph fusion \citep{sosa2017}.
