\section{Implementation: From RDF to Silicon}

The final stage of the Fused Fabric is the lowering to silicon-native code. We use ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) as our target machine-native representation.

\paragraph{Semantic-Aware Compilation}
The compiler translates RDF-encoded fused graphs into ONNX ModelProto structures. Semantic metadata is preserved in ONNX \texttt{doc\_string} and \texttt{metadata\_props}, ensuring that even at execution time, the silicon remains grounded.

\paragraph{Verification Generation}
During lowering, the compiler generates both the main inference graph and a set of \emph{assertion graphs}. These assertions implement the semantic constraints defined in the Reality Fabric (e.g., ensuring a "Probability" output remains within [0,1]).

\paragraph{Performance Results}
By fusing reasoning graphs and eliding ungrounded branches, we achieve performance gains of up to 40\% compared to manual DAG implementations, while improving auditability and formal correctness.
