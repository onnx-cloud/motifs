\begin{abstract}
We present a formal unification of static semantic grounding and dynamic computational reasoning, termed the \emph{Fused Fabric of Reality}. By synthesizing the principles of \emph{Typed Reality}---which grounds tensors in physical and symbolic ontologies (SOSA/SSN, QUDT, SKOS)---with the methodologies of \emph{Compiled Cognition}---which formalizes the fusion of heterogeneous compute graphs---we establish a singular mathematical framework for machine intelligence. We demonstrate that the grounding of observations in measurable reality is not merely a pre-processing step but a constitutive element of the reasoning process itself. Through the use of RDF-encoded models of intelligence, we define a type-preserving ABI that allows for the derivation of provably grounded and computationally efficient silicon-native code (ONNX). This paper provides the foundational formalism for an AI architecture where every inference is a verified transformation of a shared ontological-computational fabric.
